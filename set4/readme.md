Lab-book wk 4

This weeks exercises were quite tricky, the syntax for opening and closing files was overwhelming and I still wouldn't be able to write these exercises without using google a lot. The pyramid code is also written too long and poorly, there is definitely a way to be more succinct with my code but I was a bit fed up.
