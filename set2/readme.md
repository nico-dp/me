Lab-book wk 2

Exercise 0 and 1 were good for learning different commands in python, as well as learning how to format and manipulate strings.
some useful commands:
    str.upper
    f"{     }"
    len(    )

Exercise 2 was good practice for finding and correcting errors.
The code printed:

MC Hammer
MC Hammer

I learnt there are pre-made strings that you can use for your code which are found here; https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html. And I learned that if __name__ == "__main__" can be used to execute code when you run a file, but if you import set2exercise2() into another file the second MC Hammer wont print.

Exercise 3 was challenging and it took a while to get used to using for loops. 

Useful Vocabulary:

call - to run a function
concatenate - to link things together
